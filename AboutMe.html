							<p>With over 12 years of diverse experience in Information and Communication Technology (ICT), I have built a dynamic career across multiple industries, including food service, banking, healthcare, and digital marketing. My expertise spans system administration, technical support, and database management, consistently ensuring smooth operations and minimizing downtime. I began my career as a Technical Officer in the food industry, advancing to Systems Administrator in banking, where I managed system infrastructure and provided critical support.</p>
							<p>In the healthcare sector, I contributed as a Booking Administrator, streamlining patient scheduling and liaising with surgeons to optimize the surgical process. Additionally, I have over four years of experience as a Virtual Assistant, specializing in general administration and digital marketing. During this time, I provided high-quality support in social media management, email marketing, and SEO.</p>
							<p>My adaptability and versatility allow me to quickly master new tools and systems, making me an effective problem-solver in any work environment. As a proactive self-starter, I am committed to delivering high-impact results and consistently exceeding expectations.</p>
